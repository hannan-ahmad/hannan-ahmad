# Hello! I'm Hannan!

## DevOPS Engineer and Backend Application Developer.
I'm learning to be a DevOPS Engineer, with experience in Docker, Python, Linux, Bash, CI/CD. I've been working with [Sitebolts](https://sitebolts.com) since November, 2024. I'm working there as a DevOPS Engineer and a Backend application developer with Python and FastAPI.

## Game Developer and Tester.
My engine of choice at the moment is Godot and I use it with it's domain-specific language (DSL) - GDScript! I've been learning Godot since 2024, but my busy work hours and study have rendered me impossible to dedicate my time and energy to a big project at the moment. I've made some small games like top-down shooters, tower defense, platformers, and space shooters in Godot 4. Since January, 2025, I've been working with [GDQuest](https://gdquest.com) in testing out the most high-quality paid Godot 4 courses, that are currently being taught in many Game-Dev schools across France and Europe.
